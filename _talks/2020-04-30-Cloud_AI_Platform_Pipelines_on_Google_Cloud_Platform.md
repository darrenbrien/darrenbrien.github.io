title: Cloud AI Platform Pipelines on Google Cloud Platform 
---
The hype around Machine Learning often focuses on the latest and greatest models that have been built. But once you’ve built a great model how do you get it to production? How do you serve predictions to your clients at scale? How do you re-train the model with new data automatically? How do you monitor model performance over time? These are just a few of the challenges of running ML in the wild. In this talk, we will setup Cloud AI Platform Pipelines on GCP using kubeflow as an Orchestrator. We’ll use TensorFlow Extended to show how you can go from a notebook prototype to a production model in simple repeatable steps. We’ll cover some pitfalls and best practices engineers can leverage too so your next ML project gets to production fast! (and stays there!)
