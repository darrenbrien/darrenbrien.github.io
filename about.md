_The views and opinions on this website are my opinions and do not reflect the views of my current
or former employers._

* I am a technology and machine learning enthusiast living in London, UK. I grew up in North
  Yorkshire and moved to London to study for my Masters Degree in Computing from Imperial College
  London.

* When I'm not working I enjoy drinking coffee, I've done some of my most productive thinking while
  brewing a V60 pour over.

* When I'm not drinking coffee I like to keep in shape. I run a half marathon most years and
  enjoy exploring the places I visit with long run.
